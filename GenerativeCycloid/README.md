# Generative Cycloid Sketch

Simulates a mechanical drawing machine with two rotating wheels and connecting rods. The movement of a "pen" attached to the linkage traces complex cycloid-like curves. 

Users can adjust various parameters through the control panel:

*   **Wheel Speeds:** Control the rotation speed of the two main wheels and the optional canvas rotation.
*   **Radii & Attachment Points:** Define the size of the wheels and where the connecting rods attach to them.
*   **Rod Lengths:** Set the lengths of the two primary connecting rods.
*   **Pen Position:** Adjust the ratio determining where the pen is located along the second rod.
*   **Simulation Control:** Configure the total number of steps, choose instant rendering, and toggle 3D canvas rotation.

The sketch allows interactive 3D viewing (if enabled) using mouse drag and supports exporting the generated path as an SVG file.
